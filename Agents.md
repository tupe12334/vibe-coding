## General Guidelines

- Don't work on any of the tasks in the TODO.md file unless you are asked to.

- Always try to early return from functions.

- Use `const` for variables that are not reassigned.

- Make sure to focus on why and not how in documentation.

- Write predictable functions and make a spec file for them according to the testing library in use.

- Don't use `any` in TypeScript, use `unknown` instead.

- Don't cast types to a general type like `any`.

## Programming language (typescript)

- Use Interfaces over Types unless needed.

- Use `const` over `let` unless reassignment is needed.

- Use `===` over `==` for strict equality checks.

- Use arrow functions for anonymous functions.

- Use template literals for string interpolation.
